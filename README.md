\*\*Notes on the AI integration

- The shape of the data is defined in the schema at src/drizzle/src/db/schema.ts
- Each workout_plan has a weekly_schedule - each weekly_schedule entry is a single workout for a single week per workout_plan:
  weekly_schedule:{
  id: UUID,
  plan_id: UUID fk to workout_plan.id
  week_number: INT
  workout_Id: UUID fk to workout.id
  }
- When creating a new workout plan, data will need to be entered into workout_plan, weekly_schedule and workout
- A planName should also be generated by the AI - we could default to the date started or something

\*\*Code placement / architecture

- The plan generation code should be stored in /services and called by the generatePlan in srcserver/api/routers/workout-plan
- There is already a hook used in the frontend to orchestrate the generation

TODO:

- Middleware is not currently protecting routes

Next:

- submitting forms in complete-profile to make sure its submitting into the database
