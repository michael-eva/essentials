\*\*Notes on the AI integration

- The shape of the data is defined in the schema at src/drizzle/src/db/schema.ts
- Each workout_plan has a weekly_schedule - each weekly_schedule entry is a single workout for a single week per workout_plan:
  weekly_schedule:{
  id: UUID,
  plan_id: UUID fk to workout_plan.id
  week_number: INT
  workout_Id: UUID fk to workout.id
  }
- When creating a new workout plan, data will need to be entered into workout_plan, weekly_schedule and workout
- A planName should also be generated by the AI - we could default to the date started or something
